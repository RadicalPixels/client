# react-hexagon

<img align="right" width="270" height="313" src="logo/react-hexagon.png" alt="react-hexagon">

React component that renders a hexagon using SVG. Supports background images, links, SVG content, click handlers... Stylable with CSS.

## Demos

See [the demos page](http://rexxars.github.io/react-hexagon/) for some demos.

## Installation

`react-hexagon` can be installed using [npm](https://npmjs.org/):

```
npm install --save react-hexagon
```

Size of component is about ~1.5kB after gzip.

## Basic usage

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import Hexagon from 'react-hexagon'

React.render(
  <Hexagon
    style={{stroke: '#42873f'}}
    backgroundImage="img/red-panda.jpg"
    href="http://espen.codes/"
  />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## Props

All properties are optional.

* `className` - Class name of SVG element.
* `href` - Link target, if any. Hexagon will only be wrapped in an anchor if this is set.
* `target` - Target of link. Same role as in regular HTML.
* `flatTop` - Switches hexagon style to have a flat top (basically, rotate the hexagon by 90Â°). Default: `false`
* `backgroundImage` - URL to a background image. Recommend that the image has the same aspect ratio as a hexagon. See [background sizing](#background-sizing) notes below.
* `style` - Styles for the hexagon element.
* `children` - Children nodes to put inside SVG element.
* `hexProps` - Arbitrary properties to apply to the hexagon element (the actual polygon, not the outer SVG). Useful to apply event listeners, class names or similar.
* `diagonal` - Size of diagonal. Affects sizing of elements within the SVG, and can usually be left as-is. Instead, scale the SVG element using CSS width/height. Default: `500`

## Background sizing

Sizing and aligning the background image can be slightly tricky. We recommend that you try to stick with images that has the same aspect ratio as a hexagon, or square images that can be slightly scaled.

By default, if you give the hexagon element a background image with a different aspect ratio, it'll try to center the image horizontally/vertically while maintaining the original image aspect ratio. For square images, this means you'll end up with a small border. If you instead want to upscale the image to fill the hexagon, use the `backgroundScale` property (see below).

Background sizing properties are resolved in the following order (first one defined wins):

* `backgroundScale` - Used to upscale the image, usually in order to fill the entire hexagon if the aspect ratio does not match. `0.5` mean scale to 50% of the hexagon, `1.5` means scale to 150%. For square images, `1.05` is usually a good number to use.
* `backgroundWidth` / `backgroundHeight` - Used to manually adjust the size of the background image.
* `backgroundSize` - Can be used if the image has a square ratio.

**Note**: `backgroundWidth`, `backgroundHeight` and `backgroundSize` are relative to the `diagonal`, which defaults to `500`.
